Trackers use UDP because it's faster than HTTP. HTTP uses TCP, which will be used here for downloading files.

TCP ensures data arrives complete and in order but is slower because it needs to set up a connection first. UDP is faster because it sends data without connecting, but there's a chance data might get lost.

For trackers (small messages), UDP is best. For downloading files (which need to be accurate), TCP is better.
