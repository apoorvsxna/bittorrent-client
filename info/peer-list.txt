In order to get a list of peers from the tracker, the tracker will be expecting messages to follow a specific protocol. In short you must:

- Send a connect request
- Get the connect response and extract the connection id
- Use the connection id to send an announce request - this is where we tell the tracker which files weâ€™re interested in
- Get the announce response and extract the peers list
